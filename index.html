  <h1>London</h1>
  <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom,
  with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
  <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia,
  its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.The members, who joined after 12 January, had argued that having “paid their dues” they were entitled to vote in the leadership election.

A barrister representing the group has accused Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) of unlawfully freezing them and many others out of the contest between Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith.

The case was triggered by an NEC decision that full members would not be able to vote if they had not had at least six months’ continuous membership up to 12 July. The ruling affected almost 130,000 Labour supporters.

To gain the right to vote, members were given a window between 18 and 20 July to become “registered supporters” on payment of an additional £25 fee. Non-members were given the same opportunity.

Stephen Cragg QC, appearing for the five, asked Mr Justice Hickinbottom, sitting in London, to declare that party rules had been misapplied and the five are entitled to vote in the September 24 poll.

They are Christine Evangelou, Rev Edward Leir, Hannah Fordham, Chris Granger and “FM”, a new member aged under 18 who is bringing an additional challenge through his mother on the grounds of age discrimination.
